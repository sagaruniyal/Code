Election,referenda and polls 
Blockchain can be used as a distributed database to store the votes. Identity of user can be created for users on the Blockchain . These identities or accounts can be fed with tokens which will be transferred to contestant account as a valid vote. Now on the day of election a user will go to the booth, give his/her passphrase or private key (it can also be biometric data such as finger print). They will select the contestants symbol and click the button. The pre fed token will be transferred to the selected contestantâ€™s account. This record of transaction will be broadcasted to all the other nodes once it has been mined in the network.
Advantages
our data is immutable and distributed which enhances the reliability and transparency.
Identity of the voter remains anonymous
Problem of bogus voting can easily be tackled with blockchain based voting system since user will have to give their private key
Counting process becomes easy since you simply have to see the balance of different contestants
we can do all that stuff likely simillar to Bitcoins likewise in bitcoin there is every trasaction have a hash id previous id which totaly
depends on the type of data if so many miners (i.e bit miners) working on each transaction so many parallel system which stores the data .
